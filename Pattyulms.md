## Things I learned

The PATTYULMS project was filled with learning. Everystep of the way was filled with learning opportunities and new things to try.
In attempt to organize the things I learned, please refer below.

### React

React.js was chosen because it is an application I knew nothing about. Additionally I have never used React Hooks, props, and a more "Loosly" handled architecture.

### Spring Boot

### Mongo & AWS S3 Bucket

---Please see Sprint BackLog Template for all requirements with PATTYULMS

## Nonfunctional Requirements

### Uptime Robot

- Uptime Robot is a very simple and easy way to star monitoring a live site. We can add the url to the website and set how often we would like to ping our endpoint. We will get an alert if the PATTYULMS site is down.

### Logging

- Logging is an important function when it comes to this E-commerce site. With Logging implimented in PATTYULMS, the development team can trace the user lifecycle. This is important because if there are any issues, the Dev team knows where and how it occured. Additionally the team can see which items the users are looking at the most.
